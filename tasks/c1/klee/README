This directory contains all files required for the testing tasks
with LLVM's KLEE tool.

Content:
  Makefile - Makefile for building the bitcode programs and running
             KLEE (invoke with "make" or "make help" to see available
             targets)

 install.txt - Installation instructions for KLEE (can be executed
               as shell script on the reference VM).


 urldecode.c - A simple demo program demonstrating how KLEE can be
               used for testing of programs.

 offbyone.c  - Simple C program with a classic strcpy/strcat buffer
               overflow.

               Assignment: Extend "main" such that the buffer overflow
               can be automatically detected when running KLEE on the
               compiled bitcode program.
